# Diabetes_Prediction_using_ML

This project focuses on predicting whether a person (woman) is likely to develop diabetes based on various medical attributes. The prediction is made using machine learning models trained on a dataset containing historical data of patients.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to create a predictive model that can classify whether a person has diabetes based on specific diagnostic measurements. This can be used by medical professionals to identify at-risk patients and provide early intervention.
